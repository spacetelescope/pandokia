These xml files came from 

http://sourceforge.net/projects/junitpdfreport/files/junitpdfreport/JUNITPDFREPORT_1_0/

Download the zip file and look in ./src/resources/examples/testresults

This source distribution includes the license in cpl-v10.html;  under
paragraph 3, it appears that I can use these parts of the source
code here.

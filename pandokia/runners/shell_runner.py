# test runner that runs shell scripts - this is primarily an example of how
# to add a new test runner, though in principle you could use it for real
# tests.
#
# shell_runner runs a shell script.  The basename of the file is the name
# of the test.  The exit status of the script determines the test result.
#
# pdk_shell_runner is a shell script that performs the test.  We are not
# passing any parameters to it because it gathers them all from the environment.
# See the script source in commands/pdk_shell_runner.

# Since we were in a hurry to get it working, we use certain sqlite3
# features:
#
# These sqlite features are:
#
# PRAGMA synchronous = NORMAL;
#   FULL = pause to wait for data to get to disk; guards against
#       db corruption in case of system crash, but slow
#   NORMAL = pause only at the most critical moments
#   OFF = hand off writes to the OS and continue; as much as 50
#       times faster than FULL, but if the OS crashes or you
#       lose power, the db might get corrupted.
#
# You would think that OFF might be a good choice because we don't do a
# lot of writes, but we have a problem once or twice a year that seems to
# be related to killing an import.
#
# db.text_factory = str
#   cause all strings to be extracted as str instead of unicode.
#
#   Some of the STSCI log files contain byte sequences that look like
#   invalid UTF-8 sequences.  It manages to insert the invalid UTF-8
#   into the database, but chokes on extracting them.  So, for now,
#   it's all 8 bit ASCII.  Or 8859-1 if you prefer...
#

# can't avoid writing per-database code

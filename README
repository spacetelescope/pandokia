"All your test are belong to us!"


What is here
--

INSTALL
	installation instructions

commands
	commands that you type to invoke pandokia

doc
	documentation here

pandokia
	the pandokia python module

pandokia_top
	indicator that test runner should not look above this directory
	for environment files; This is not the root of a test tree, but
	if we leave pandokia_top out of a subdirectory, this will limit
	the top of the tree.

setup.py
	standard distutils-based installer; also works with easy_install
	and pip.

stsci_regtest
	a special test system used locally at STScI to test IRAF
        code. There are some associated files in commands and runners 
        as well.
        Not for general use.

stsci_regtest_tests
        its associated tests

tests
	various tests that pandokia can run; as of version 1.0,
	this is not a test suite of pandokia that we expect to pass
	all tests, but it is a set of tests that help us in
	testing/development.  ( Pandokia does not have a test suite
	that tests the pandokia system; the irony of that is not
	lost on us. )

patches

	Pandokia if it wasn't covered under GPL

setimages.py
	inserts image data into pandokia/common.py ; this will be the
	logo at the top of the web pages.  knows .jpg and .png

	separate repository.

# This program reads this format from STDIN:

# project,prefix,contact
#
# There are commas between fields because there are blank fields sometimes.
# project is the project name
# prefix is the name of a prefix
# contact is the email address of a contact
#
# There can be multiple lines for each project/prefix.

Database Programming in Pandokia
===============================================================================

:abstract:

    Pandokia uses a SQL-based database.  It uses it directly through DBAPI,
    not through an ORM.  There are some conventions to follow to implement
    more portable SQL.

DBAPI limitations
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DBAPI defines something that looks like a standard interface to databases,
but you can't quite write a program assuming DBAPI and expect it to work
with any database that offers a DBAPI interface.

One big problem comes in parameter passing.  If you look at PEP 249
( http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/ ), you can see 5 possible
values for paramstyle.  None of them are available in every database.

Notably, mysqldb and pyscopg2 offer only 'format' and 'pyformat', while
sqlite3 offers 'qmark', 'named', and some parameter formats that are not 
part of DBAPI.

Solution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The solution is an SQL execute that converts a standard format for parameters
to whatever the database engine wants.

cursor = pdk_db.execute( statement, parameters )

    perform a database action with named parameters

    statement contains an instance of :AAA for each named parameter.
    The parameter name has to match the regular expression pattern [a-zA-Z0-9\_]+

    If parameters is a dict, it will be used as-is.

    If parameters is a list or tuple, it will be converted into
    a dict with keys '1', '2', '3', ..., so you can write your
    query using :1, :2, :3, etc.

    If parameters is any other type, it is an error.

    It IS NOT permitted to have the character ':' in your sql,
    even if it occurs inside a string literal.  The library
    does not check for this, but will likely choke on your
    query.

    It IS NOT permitted to have the character '%' in your sql,
    even if it occurs inside a string literal.  This limitation
    is inherited from some of the DBAPI implementations.  You
    may be able to get away with it, depending which DBAPI you
    are using, but your code will not be portable.

    Notably, you cannot use LIKE 'xxx%' but you can use LIKE :1 and
    pass a parameter of "xxx%".

The return value is a cursor 

Why this interface?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is easy and fast for regex substition to convert this to something
that any dbapi database can use.

I would like your sql to be allowed to say " where a like 'arf%' ",
but the % will not correctly pass through some of the dbapi
implementations.  Since this interface is intended to be portable,
you can't have the %.  You have to do " where a like :1 " and pass
'arf%' as a parameter.

Stylistically, I like ":arf" better than "%(arf)s"

Some people like ORMs, but I find them substantially harder to use
than regular SQL.  Some queries that are easy in SQL are difficult
or impossible in some ORMs.

What about performance?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This interface takes a small amount of additional time for each query, but
the performance reduction from using an interpreted language like Python is
so large that I don't notice (or care) about the difference.  The portability
is more important.

This interface has not been benchmarked against common ORM implementations
such as those available in SqlAlchemy or Django, but those systems use
much more complex methods for constructing queries.  I conjecture that any
performance difference favors this interface, but that the total difference
is insignificant.

Connecting to the databse
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Within pandokia 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

    import pandokia
    pdb_db = pandokia.cfg.pdk_db

    cursor = pdk_db.execute( query, parameters )

Always fully specify the columns to retrieve; never use "SELECT \*".

Use :1, :2, ... for parameters when you have only a fixed set of parameters. ::

    c = pdk_db.execute("select a, b from tbl where a = :1 and b = :2",('a_value','b_value'))
    for x in c :
        print c[0],c[1]

Without pandokia
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 - using MySQLdb: ::

    import etc_utils.db_mysql

    db = etc_utils.db_mysql.PandokiaDB( access_arg )
        # access_arg is the same as you would use with MySQLdb

 - using sqlite3 or pysqlite2: ::

    import etc_utils.db_sqlite

    db = etc_utils.db_sqlite.PandokiaDB( filename )
        # filename is the same as you would use with sqlite3

 - using psyscopg2 (postgresql): ::

    import etc_utils.db_psycopg2

    db = etc_utils.db_psycopg2.PandokiaDB( access_arg )
        # access_arg is the same as you would use with psycopg2

 - using pymssql (Microsoft SQL Server): ::

    import etc_utils.db_pymssql

    db = etc_utils.db_pymssql.PandokiaDB( access_arg )
        # access_arg is the same as you would use with pymssql

The object does not connect to the database when you create it.
You can call db.open() to explicitly connect, or it will connect
to the database the first time it needs the connection.


Without pandokia, if you have a Django settings.py module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

    # hook up to the database
    import etc_utils.db as dbm
    import pyetc.etc_web.settings as settings

    db = dbm.db_from_django( settings )

This works for mysql and sqlite.

The object does not connect to the database when you create it.
You can call db.open() to explicitly connect, or it will connect
to the database the first time it needs the connection.

Schemas
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you use database-specfic features in your schema, you just have
to write a separate schema for each database engine.

There are a few significant differences in schemas for different
databases:

 - sqlite databases allow VARCHAR without a length, but others do not.

 - Different databases use different approaches to autoincrementing
   columns.  See result_scalar.key_id in pandokia/sql/\*.sql to see
   the different approaches.

 - Some databases do not have auto-increment columns.  This abstraction
   layer cannot hide that for you.

 - The details of what indexes you want may vary between database
   implementations.

This lacks the "magic" of an ORM automatically generating your
schema, but is not so bad if you have a small number of tables 
or a small number of databases.

Dynamically constructed WHERE clauses
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

where_dict is a function to dynamically construct WHERE clauses, based
on a list of column names and values.

The parameter to where_dict is a list of ( column_name, value ),
where column_name is a required column name and value is a value
to match.  All the columns are ANDed together.  If the value for
a column is a list, the possible values are ORed together.

The value may contain "\*x", "x\*", or "\*x\*", which will be converted
to "%x", "x%", or "%x%" and used in a LIKE clause.  Other glob-like
characters are not permitted.

If the value contains '%', it will be used in a LIKE clause.  

The '_' character does NOT automatically create a LIKE expression
because it is too common in our data values, but note that "A_B*"
will translate to LIKE 'A_B%'

There is no good way to search for values containing \*, %, [, or ? 

Example: ::

    where_text, where_dict = pdk_db.where_dict( [ 
        ( 'a', 1 ), 
        ( 'b', [ 'x', 'y' ] ),
        ( 'c', 'z*' )
        ] )

    c = pdk_db.execute("SELECT a,b FROM tb %s"%where_text, where_dict)

is equivalent to ::

    where_text = "WHERE ( a = :1 ) AND ( b = :2 OR b = :3 ) AND ( c LIKE :4 )"
    where_dict = { 
        '1' : 1,
        '2' : 'x',
        '3' : 'y',
        '4' : 'z%'
        }
    c = pdk_db.execute("SELECT a,b FROM tb %s"%where_text, where_dict)


COMMIT / ROLLBACK
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Commit and rollback work the same as with dbapi; use the pandokia database object: ::

    pdk_db.commit()

    pdk_db.rollback()


Exceptions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IntegrityError happens when you violate a database constraint. ::

    db = xxx.PandokiaDB( args )

    try :
        c = db.execute('INSERT INTO ...')
    except db.IntegrityError as e :
        ...

ProgrammingError is a problem such as a syntax error in your SQL. ::

    try :
        c = db.execute('...')
    except db.ProgrammingError as e :
        ...

DBAPI implementations can raise other exceptions that are not yet
implemented by the pandokia interface.

Postgres will raise an exception if you get an error from one SQL
statement and to not rollback() before executing more statements.

Table Usage
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can ask the database for the amount of space used by the data.
There is not always a clear answer to this question, but this
function returns the best available answer in a database specific
way: ::

    i = db.table_usage()
    print "using %d bytes"%i

In mysql, this is the sum of the table and index sizes from "SHOW TABLE STATUS".

In sqlite3, this is the size of the database file.


EXPLAIN QUERY
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can get a description of how the database will evaluate the query with: ::

    s = pdk_db.explain_query( text, qhere_dict )
    print s

This is highly database dependent.

# A *.snout file contains a list of _installed_ modules/packages
# to run nose on.  It happens that this can run doctests, but it
# really runs any tests that nose can recognize.

# Each of these happens to be a module from the standard library that
# contains various doctests.

# oddly enough, nose cannot run the doctests in the module 'doctest'
# -- it contains a class with "Test" in it's name that crashes when
# instantiated.

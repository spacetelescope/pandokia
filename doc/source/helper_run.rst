Python: Running external executables in your test
===============================================================================

There are some helper functions for running external programs.  You can
use these instead of any of the half-dozen or so variants of popen that
are in the standard library.  This interface is simpler, it will not
be deprecated as often as the other popen variants, and it is easier
to be compatible with python testing packages.

Do not use subprocess
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You most likely want to capture the stdout and stderr of the external
program in your test log.  By default, this will not work in
subprocess -- it will go to the stdout/stderr of pdkrun.  If you
want to use subprocess, you have to take special actions to capture
the stdout/stderr and repeat it into Python's stdout/stderr.

Instead, use the run_process function: ::

    # NO
    import subprocess
    subprocess.call( [ 'ls', '-l' ] )

    # YES
    import pandokia.helpers.process as process
    
    # run the program, capturing output into a file
    status = process.run_process( [ 'ls', '-l' ], output_file='myfile.tmp' )

    # read the file and print it to the stdout being used by the test
    process.cat( [ "myfile.tmp" ] )

Since Pandokia will only run one test at a time in any working directory,
it is not necessary to guarantee a unique name for the temp file.  Since
the output file will be created, it is not necessary to delete it
before using it.


Running an external process
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

``run_process`` executes a command with stdout/stderr redirected into a file: ::

    import pandokia.helpers.process as pr
    import os

    arg = [ 'ls', '-ld', '.' ]

    # run the process with arg list, using default environment and output file
    status = pr.run_process( arg )

    # explicitly read the output
    out = open('output_file','r').read()
    print "output was:"
    print out
    print "exit code is %d" % status

    # run the process, explicitly specify everything
    status = pr.run_process( arg, env=os.environ, output_file='myfile.tmp' )
    out = open('myfile.tmp','r').read()

    # just repeat the output to our own stdout
    print "output was:"
    pr.cat( [ 'myfile.tmp' ] )
    print "exit code is %d" % status

``cat`` reads each file in a list and writes the content to stdout: ::
    
    import pandokia.helpers.process as pr
    pr.cat( [ 'myfile.tmp' ] )

This is much like ``os.system("cat myfile.tmp")`` with one significant
difference:  os.system will write stdout to the same stdout that pandokia
is writing to, so the output will not appear in your test report;
``process.cat`` will write the output into the sys.stdout that the test
is using, which means that the file content will appear
in the test report.

IRAF tasks
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have Pyraf installed, you can run IRAF tasks: ::

    import utils.helpers.filecomp as filecomp
    import pandokia.helpers.process as process

    tda = { }

    f = open('parfile','w')
    f.write('''
    input,s,a,"dev$pix",,,Input images
    output,s,a,"foo.fits",,,Output images or directory
    verbose,b,h,no,,,Print operations performed?
    mode,s,h,ql
    ''')
    f.close()

    filecomp.safe_rm('foo.fits')

    process.run_pyraf_task('imcopy', 'parfile', output_file='foo.txt', tda=tda )

The tda dict is optional.  If you supply it, task parameters will be entered as TDAs.

This is a simplified interface for pyraf tasks.  You can also use the full
capabilities of pyraf directly.

If the task returns an error, it will raise pr.RunPyrafTaskException which contains
the values ``task`` and ``err``: ::

    except process.RunPyrafTaskException as e :
        print "task ",e.task
        print "err  ",e.err

The call may also raise any of the pyraf-related exceptions.

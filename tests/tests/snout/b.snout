# "snout" is not really a good name for this test runner because
# it runs more than just doctests.  It runs any test that nose
# recognizes.
#
# The thing that makes the snout runner different is that it runs
# the tests on _installed_ software, while the pdknose runner runs
# the tests on files stored in the test directory.
